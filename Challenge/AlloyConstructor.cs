         To implement:

        1. Write test for AlloyConstructor. Use Moq to generate random Combinations through AllCombinations[index]. Index value is the one generated. 
        2. Build Alloy Constructor function that pulls values from IComposition, ITotalCost and ITotalCreep and asigns them to local variables.
        3. Create 2 Dictionaries that takes Combination lists from AllCombinations as Keys and TotalCreep and TotalCost as Values.
        4. Cut off all entries from Cost and Creep dict that have Cost >18.0. (Cutting Creep is based off keys)
        5. Obtain max Creep value from Dictionary, get the corresponding Key.
        6. Find corresponding value in Cost dictionary (same key)
        7. declare result as a public double
